# Smart-Water-Dispenser-Project
 This project involves designing a Smart Water Dispenser that allows users to select water temperature (hot, cold, lukewarm) and dispense accordingly. It was implemented in two stages: one using analog and digital components with a custom PCB, and another using Arduino for real-time temperature monitoring and user interaction.
